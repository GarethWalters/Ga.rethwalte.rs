			The experts on demand framework was an app platform that allowed for clients to video chat with experts on a pay-per-minute model on any business model. Shown below are two examples: Fixup and Psychics on demand â€” as requested by my employer. The platform was built to allow a new iPhone app to be built in under a day. Meaning, simple graphic and compile settings allowed us to take on any number of business models rapidly.
		</p>
		<p>
			The app featured a list of experts in a particular field (per compiled iPhone app), their rating based on previous experiences, their likelyhood to answer a call, and their cost per minute. Users could find an expert they liked from this list, or could use our server's algorithm to quickly connect to the best available expert.
		</p>
		<p>
			I led the iOS user interface/experience &amp; graphic design, and designed all of the JSON network calls. I tested all networking in a local environment before our back-end team approved my design and built the working server-side.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to business indecision, lack of experts, and minimal marketing, the app was pulled shortly after launch.
