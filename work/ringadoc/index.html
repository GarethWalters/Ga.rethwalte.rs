			Ringadoc is a service that connects patients with a licenced doctor in their state. For this project, The iPhone app created allowed patients to quickly connect to a doctor through a video consultation. Ringadoc left our incubator to receive over $1.9 million in funding.
		</p>
		<p>
			The iPhone application contained separate experiences for patients and doctors. Patients could record their concerns and existing conditions before quickly being connected to a licenced doctor in their state. Doctors could login to review medical history of a potential patient before choosing whether to accept their call, as well as prescribing legal drugs from the app.
		</p>
		<p>
			I led the iOS user interface/experience &amp; graphic design, and worked with a small team to build the interface for both the patient and the doctor.
		</p>
		<p>
			A new iteration of the app is available on the store. This version has greatly stripped the functionality in favor of a more practical user experience. Unfortunately, we were unable to convince patients that discussing their health concerns over video chat was a great idea.
